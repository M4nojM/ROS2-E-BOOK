    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to our journey with ROS2! As authors of this e-book, we are excited to document our experience as beginner learners in the field of robotics and automation. Our goal is to share our learning journey with you, in the hopes that it will be useful for others who are new to ROS2 as well.\nWe are two friends, Rishikesavan Ramesh and Manoj M, who share a passion for robotics and automation. Together, we decided to explore ROS2 as a way to build our skills and gain practical experience in the field. Along the way, we encountered many challenges, took risks, and learned valuable lessons that we want to share with others.\nIn this e-book, we will take you through our journey with ROS2, from the basics of getting started to more advanced topics like application development and contributing to the ROS2 community. We have organized the content in a way that we hope will be easy to follow, with plenty of examples and practical tips to help you along the way.\nOur approach to learning involves documenting our experiences and creating a resource that can help other beginners on the same path. We believe that this approach can be very useful, as it provides a real-world perspective on the learning process and can help new beginners avoid some of the common pitfalls and mistakes.\nWhether you are a beginner just starting out with ROS2 or an intermediate learner looking to expand your skills, we hope that this e-book will be a valuable resource for you. So join us on our adventurous path with ROS2, and let’s explore the exciting world of robotics and automation together!\nYou can find our LinkedIn profiles at\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/manoj-murali-/ and https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishikesavan-ramesh/."

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nYou are reading the work-in-progress edition of ROS 2 : Mea Via et Mea Disciplina. This chapter is currently a dumping ground for ideas, and we don’t recommend reading it. The complete version will be available here soon. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nROS (Robot Operating System) was first released by Open Robotics in 2007 as a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. At the core of a ROS system are independent nodes that communicate with each other using a publish/subscribe messaging platform. For example, a sensor’s driver could be implemented as a node that publishes sensor data, and this data can be read by any number of other nodes, such as filters, loggers, mapping, and navigation nodes. What’s great about ROS is that these nodes can be on different systems or used by different architectures, making it flexible and adaptable to users’ needs.\nROS 2 is the next version of ROS and includes many of the same components and tools as its predecessor, but also adds new features like an improved communication stack with real-time data distribution service (DDS) protocol, support for multiple DDS implementations, and DDS security support. It also offers improved logging capabilities, ability to configure QoS at startup, improved rosbag2 performance, and more. ROS 2 is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure, making it a great choice for building robotic applications."
