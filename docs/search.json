    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to our journey with ROS2! As authors of this e-book, we are excited to document our experience as beginner learners in the field of robotics and automation. Our goal is to share our learning journey with you, in the hopes that it will be useful for others who are new to ROS2 as well.\nWe are two friends, Rishikesavan Ramesh and Manoj M, who share a passion for robotics and automation. Together, we decided to explore ROS2 as a way to build our skills and gain practical experience in the field. Along the way, we encountered many challenges, took risks, and learned valuable lessons that we want to share with others.\nIn this e-book, we will take you through our journey with ROS2, from the basics of getting started to more advanced topics like application development and contributing to the ROS2 community. We have organized the content in a way that we hope will be easy to follow, with plenty of examples and practical tips to help you along the way.\nOur approach to learning involves documenting our experiences and creating a resource that can help other beginners on the same path. We believe that this approach can be very useful, as it provides a real-world perspective on the learning process and can help new beginners avoid some of the common pitfalls and mistakes.\nWhether you are a beginner just starting out with ROS2 or an intermediate learner looking to expand your skills, we hope that this e-book will be a valuable resource for you. So join us on our adventurous path with ROS2, and let’s explore the exciting world of robotics and automation together!\nYou can find our LinkedIn profiles at\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/manoj-murali-/ and https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishikesavan-ramesh/."

Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nROS (Robot Operating System) was first released by Open Robotics in 2007 as a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. At the core of a ROS system are independent nodes that communicate with each other using a publish/subscribe messaging platform. For example, a sensor’s driver could be implemented as a node that publishes sensor data, and this data can be read by any number of other nodes, such as filters, loggers, mapping, and navigation nodes. What’s great about ROS is that these nodes can be on different systems or used by different architectures, making it flexible and adaptable to users’ needs.\nROS 2 is the next version of ROS and includes many of the same components and tools as its predecessor, but also adds new features like an improved communication stack with real-time data distribution service (DDS) protocol, support for multiple DDS implementations, and DDS security support. It also offers improved logging capabilities, ability to configure QoS at startup, improved rosbag2 performance, and more. ROS 2 is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure, making it a great choice for building robotic applications."

    "text": "3.1 Sourcing the binaries\nBy default, when you install ROS2, it does not source its binaries automatically. This means that you will need to manually source the setup file to use the ROS2 binaries.\nThere are several reasons why ROS2 doesn’t source its binaries by default:\n\n3.1.1 Isolation:\nROS2 supports multiple installations of itself and its dependencies, so not sourcing the binaries by default allows for better isolation between different installations. This means that you can have multiple ROS2 installations on the same machine without them interfering with each other.\n\n\n3.1.2 Flexibility:\nBy not sourcing the binaries by default, ROS2 allows you to choose which version of the software to use for each terminal session. This is useful when working on different projects that require different versions of ROS2.\n\n\n3.1.3 Avoiding conflicts:\nSourcing the binaries by default can cause conflicts with other software installed on your machine that may use the same environment variables.\nIn summary, not sourcing the binaries by default in ROS2 allows for better isolation, flexibility, and avoids conflicts with other software on your machine. However, it does require a manual step to set up each terminal session to use ROS2, which can be seen as a minor inconvenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis can be advantageous when you want to work on multiple projects that require you to install multiple distros.\nCreating a shortcut would be helpful. Here is how,\nStep 1: Create a file in your home directory,\ntouch ~/.ros2_config\nStep 2: Edit ~/.bashrc and ~/.ros2_config\necho \"alias shumble=\"source ~/.ros2_config\"\" >> ~/.bashrc\necho \"source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash\" > ~/.ros2_config\nIt is advisable to edit the ~/.bashrc as less as possible, so that reducing the risk of misconfiguring the vital configurations in the ~/.bashrc\nYou can now twerk ~/.ros2_config to change any ros related settings, while it being isolated from other configurations."

It is a process that communicates with other nodes in the system through topics, services, and parameters.\n\n\n\nSource ros.org\n\n\nNodes are often designed to perform a single function or task, such as reading data from a sensor, processing that data, or controlling an actuator. Nodes can be written in a variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, and others.\nNodes communicate with each other by publishing and subscribing to topics. A topic is a named bus over which nodes can send and receive messages. When a node publishes a message to a topic, all other nodes that are subscribed to that topic will receive the message.\nNodes can also provide and consume services. A service is a named request/response pair of messages that a node can use to get or set information or perform a specific action. A node that provides a service listens for requests, performs the requested action, and sends back a response.\nNodes can also use parameters to store and retrieve configuration data. A parameter is a named value that can be set and read by nodes in the system. Parameters can be used to configure a node’s behavior or to store information such as calibration data.\nIn summary, nodes are the building blocks of a ROS2 system, and they communicate with each other through topics, services, and parameters. Each node performs a specific function or task, and together they form a distributed system that can be used to control robots or other complex systems."
